## üñºÔ∏è Multimedia Files

- All **image files** are provided as individual zip archives by game:
  - `FATPicDoc.zip` ‚Äì For all Time  
  - `LNPicDoc.zip` ‚Äì Light and Night  
  - `MDPPicDoc.zip` ‚Äì Mr. Love: Deep Space  
  - `MQCPicDoc.zip` ‚Äì Mr. Love: Queen's Choice  
  - `ToTPicDoc.zip` ‚Äì Tears of Themis  

  These files are available in the `OtomeVM_Pics/` folder in this repository.

- All corresponding **video files are hosted externally via Google Drive**:
  - üîó [OtomeVM Video Files (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OgxrJPFoNwFfu1pui77rfEUFMz3G5rH6?usp=sharing)

  The linked folder contains a directory named `OtomeVM_Videos`, which includes subfolders for each game:
  - `FATvideos/`
  - `LNvideos/`
  - `MDSvideos/`
  - `MQCvideos/`
  - `ToTvideos/`

  Within each game folder, there are two subdirectories:
  - `Original/` ‚Äì contains the raw video files as named by the last segment of the original Weibo media URL.
  - `Compressed/` ‚Äì contains compressed versions of the same videos.

  Compressed videos are processed by reducing the **resolution to 720P** and the **frame rate to 10 frames per second**, significantly reducing file size for efficient storage and transfer.  
  File names remain consistent, with the compressed versions prefixed with `"compressed"` for clarity.  
  Please download from the appropriate folder according to your needs.
